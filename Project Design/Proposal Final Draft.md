**Foreign Language Immersion Virtual Reality**

**Problem Statement:**

The ideal method for foreign language acquisition is for the learner to be fully immersed in the language and culture of their target language while also studying the language and using it every day.

Most people who try becoming fluent in a foreign language fail to do so. The problem is that the traditional methods used focus on only learning the language and not using it and immersing the students in the language. This is important because a student who spends their time and/or money on classes should see results, but the majority do not. One statistic shows that less than 1% of US students who enrolled in a world language class in high school can engage in simple conversation after college (Schutzler), and another study shows that 80% of British students cannot do anything more than understand basic phrases in their target language (Ward).

In many cases, people cannot travel to the country of their target language and learn, but Foreign Language Immersion Virtual Reality (FLIVR) would solve this problem by mimicking the experience. FLIVR will provide activities for learners to apply the things they learn through their studies, but in an environment that also achieves language acquisition through language immersion. Language learners should use FLIVR to accompany their language studies because using the program will help them practice and retain what they learn while experiencing the language immersion similar to being in the country of their target language.

**Project Description:**

FLIVR will feature an open world that is fully explorable for the user. Items in the world can be interacted with and will be remembered by the program so that they can be used in other in-game activities to test the user’s memory and further solidify their vocabulary. The name of the object interacted with will be displayed in a heads-up display (HUD) and the pronunciation of the object will be given audibly. Also, the program will then add the object to a database that would be used in activities throughout FLIVR. The user will be able to repeat the pronunciation as much as they want until they deselect or put the object down.

Activities in the game will either work seamlessly with the open-world aspect of the game or will utilize a loading screen depending on the capabilities of the hardware. Certain areas will be dedicated for activities and the user will complete tasks. Completing the tasks will require the user to remember words that they have encountered, and the activities will evolve the longer the user uses the application. The program will use dynamic difficulty balancing that will be based on the user’s performance while doing activities. If the user is not performing well, then the game will recognize this and show the user the material they are not proficient in.

The environment or setting of the program will be an accurate simulation of a portion of a city in America. If time provides, more areas will be added, but a city environment will provide many activities for a user to learn from and many people and objects to interact with. The detail and look of the environment will be heavily focused on to best replicate how it would be in real life, but since this project is to be made to be available to as many people as possible it will be limited to the hardware capabilities of an Oculus Quest 2.

**Proposed Implementation Language(s):**

Unreal Engine 4: Blueprint (Visual Scripting), C++, Python

**Proposed Libraries, Packages, Development Kits, etc.:**

Google Speech API

WordsAPI using RestAPI: Calls to JSON files on a web server to get meaning, synonym, antonym, part of speech, usage example, pronunciation and hyphenation for a given word.

*CTRL Human: Conversational AI that supports 2-way conversation and dynamic body gestures. Natively supported by Unreal Engine 4 and has built in support for Chatbot AI, Speech to Text, and Text to Speech.*

*Not confirmed – currently trying to get access to the software for academic use.

**Software/Equipment Needed:**

Software: Unreal Engine 4

Equipment: Oculus Quest 2 and controllers, link cable to test and load code on Oculus Quest from my computer.

**Personal Motivation:**

I picked this as my project because I believe that many people do not understand the societal and personal benefits of learning foreign languages. Six months ago, I started learning Russian and through doing this I have learned a lot about myself and have met many amazing people. I want everyone to have the chance to experience what I have experienced. I am very interested in how virtual reality (VR) can be used to help people learn skills and simulate real-life situations. By creating FLIVR I would be helping many people by making the learning process enjoyable and practical while also exploring the possibilities of using VR to learn.

**Outline of Future Research Efforts:**

The expected deliverable is a program that supplements English learning and would greatly improve the user’s vocabulary knowledge and help them practice what they learn outside of using the program. There are five key features I want to implement.

1. A city environment that can be interacted with and that exposes the user to new vocabulary. The end goal of this would be passively learning just like how a person passively learns vocabulary of their native language.

2. A HUD that features the pronunciation of what is being interacted with and a description.

3.  A database that tracks the user’s progress and words they have encountered and know.

4.  *Activities that test the user’s memory and give feedback showing what words they do not know.

5. *Activities that test the user’s ability to construct responses based on the situation of the activity.

*The goal is to use CRTL Human to simulate these interactions. If this is not achievable, there will be other activities/games that will be played to help with learning vocabulary.*

**Schedule:**

2021

February-March: Further research into Unreal Engine and getting used to the software. Researching how memory works when learning a language and how to apply this to the project.

March: Finish requirements for applying for trip and send proposal, CV, and proof of studies.

April 6: Complete final draft of requirements document and submit final proposal.

April-May: Further testing in Unreal Engine. Development begins in May.

Jun-July: Spend most of the time creating the necessities of the program. This includes the program menu and settings interface, creation of the environment, interactivity with objects, HUD display with pronunciation, database system to keep track of progress, and start development on the activities to test the user’s memory.

August-September: Creation of the activities that would be played to remember words and phrases.

September: Finish developing the test plan for user evaluations.

October-November: Debugging and adding more features.

December-January: Testing in Vietnam and getting feedback.

2022

January-February: Organizing all feedback that was received and implementing the ideas. Start creation of the defense documentation.

March-May: Continue optimizing program, debugging, and add minor enhancements to make it more user-friendly. Finish Defense documentation and present project.

April 4: Finish project documentation portfolio.

April 8: Run through presentation with advisor.

April 15: Present project at senior-project defense.
